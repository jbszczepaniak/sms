### SMS - Socks Management System

How frequently does it happen to you that you wake up in the morning, you want to just leave the house but you're struggling to find pair of matching socks?. It's even worse when you wake up before sunrise and you don't really really see what you're choosing from.

Struggle no more - Socks Management System is here to help.

It's united tested and I am running it in production for a while without any outages. I invite you to learn about SMS.

Basically this helps you to go from this

![before](./before.png)

to this:

![after](./after.png)

or if you really like perfection, to this (it requires ironing socks, it's for pro users only):

![after_extreme](./after_extreme.png)

So the idea is very simple. It assumes that you spend time on searching for socks anyway but you spend this time not when you're frustrated, but when you're plenty of time.

You need two organizers. IKEA SKUBB is alright, you can use that, it's cheap, you probably have it somewhere in the house anyway because you were wandering around IKEA and thought SKUBB will solve all orgrnization problems at your place. 

Organizer #1 is going to be a queue. Organizer #2 is going to be just a bag of socks. Whenever you do the loundry, you take all your fresh socks and put it in Organizer #2. Then you take all of the socks from Organizer #2 one by one, and whenever you find a matching pair
you put it at the end of the queue. In the morning, you dequeue - that's it. If there is nothing in the queue - it's clear sign you need to do the laundry.


## FAQ
1. Did you really needed to create this project?
Yes

2. Why not just roll the socks and put into baskets without stupid queues? In the morning take first sock-roll and call it a day.

Because it breaks your socks, the elastic band that ends the sock loosens and it gets ugly, you don't want that. Other reason would be - this idea makes your socks too look nice in the drawer.

Also without a queue when you fold and roll your socks and you put them into common basket - you wear some of the socks more frequently than others - it's bad. Wearing off all of the socks in the same pace is much better.
